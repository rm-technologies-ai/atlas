## Information Synchronized Across Files

The following information is now consistent across all documentation:

### Project Identity
- Name: Atlas (ATLAS Data Science / Lion / Paxium)
- Type: Brownfield commercial platform at 30% completion
- Root: `E:\repos\atlas\` (Windows) / `/mnt/e/repos/atlas/` (WSL)
- GitHub: https://github.com/rm-technologies-ai/atlas (private)
- GitLab: `atlas-datascience/lion` group
- MVP Target: December 2025

### Archon Integration
- Location: `/mnt/e/repos/atlas/archon/`
- Frontend UI: http://localhost:3737
- API Server: http://localhost:8181
- MCP Server: http://localhost:8051
- Database: Supabase with pgvector
- AI Provider: OpenAI (configurable)

### Directory Structure
1. `/archon/` - RAG/Graph knowledge and task management (MCP server)
2. `/issues/` - GitLab issue export tool
3. Future projects as needed

### Technical Stack
- Backend: Node.js, Next.js, Python
- Cloud: AWS (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- Platform: GitLab CI/CD (pipelines, runners)
- Knowledge: Archon (Supabase + pgvector, OpenAI)
- Development: WSL, Docker Desktop, VS Code

### Environment & Secrets
- Master file: `.env.atlas` in root (gitignored)
- Subfolder configs source from `.env.atlas`
- Contains: GitLab tokens, GitHub creds, Supabase, OpenAI, AWS

### Core Workflow
1. Archon-first task management (CRITICAL rule)
2. Research before coding using RAG queries
3. Task status: `todo` → `doing` → `review` → `done`
4. Knowledge base queries optimize context window
5. Hierarchical traceability for all work items

## Obsolete Information Removed

1. ❌ References to Archon as "planned" or "future installation"
2. ❌ Outdated MCP tool names (`manage_task` → `find_tasks` + `manage_task`)
3. ❌ Vague "additional tools will be added" without specifics
4. ❌ Redundant or conflicting task status information
5. ❌ Incomplete quick start instructions missing Archon
6. ❌ References to deprecated RAG query methods

## New Capabilities Added

1. ✅ **Archon MCP Integration** - Direct access to knowledge base and task management from Claude Code
2. ✅ **RAG Knowledge Queries** - Semantic search for Lion architecture, code examples, documentation
3. ✅ **Task-Driven Development** - Research → Plan → Implement → Review cycle with Archon
4. ✅ **Context Window Optimization** - Intelligent loading of relevant knowledge for each task
5. ✅ **GitLab Knowledge Ingestion** - Ability to import wikis, issues, and repos into searchable knowledge base
6. ✅ **Multi-Level Research** - High-level architecture + low-level API queries in single workflow
7. ✅ **Code Example Search** - Find implementation patterns before coding
8. ✅ **Feature-Based Organization** - Tasks aligned with project features for better structure

## Next Steps

1. **Review Drafts:** Examine `.draft` files and validate accuracy
2. **Apply Changes:** If approved, replace original files with draft versions:
   ```bash
   mv CLAUDE.md.draft CLAUDE.md
   mv README.md.draft README.md
   mv TODO.md.draft TODO.md
   ```
3. **Commit Updates:** Add and commit synchronized documentation:
   ```bash
   git add CLAUDE.md README.md TODO.md
   git commit -m "Synchronize documentation with Archon integration"
   ```
4. **Begin Data Ingestion:** Start importing Lion project data into Archon
5. **Validate TDD Criteria:** Test Archon knowledge base queries with Lion architecture question

## Validation Checklist

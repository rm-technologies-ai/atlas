environment: 
- I run Windows 11 Pro. Use Claude Code and ChatGPT as AI assistants. I use VS Code, with default to WSL terminal an operation. I use Docker Desktop integrated with WSL.
- interact heavily with gitlab and have created some utilities already using the rest api.

behavior:
- don't give me choices. Always default to correct, precise, succinct, complete, pragmatic aproach.
au
role: 
- I am the technical project manager responsible for the ATLAS Data Science (lion, paxium) project. 
  - It is a brownfield commercial project at 30% completion
  - It's predecessor was developed during  10 years of solutioning for the NGA in data and image governance, search, analysis,disemination and lineage.
- I have execute multiple roles for this project including:
  - project manager
  - scrum master
  - solutions architect
  - platform engineer
  - solutions engineer
  - Next.js, node, AWS, Python and AI developer

project:
- This Project is a repository that contains solutions, knowledge or working spaces for a collection of Assets, Projects, research , and Git Repos created or leveraged during the execution of this project.
  - iterative, ad-hoc, hirearchical taxonomy to be used, use only required, minimal scaffolding.
  - Open source tools will be cloned into this repo and built from here. multiple projects will reside here and consume shared resources.
  - I want to preserve customizations required for tool or app use when cloning apps or code.

tasks:

1. identify and define the missing Scrum Product Backlog Items (PBIs) for a brownfield effort.

- Implement a RAG/Graph solution that can be accessed and properly consumed by Claude Code (cc), during the ad-hoc execution of the workflows defined in the BMAD method agentic framework.
- Install, configure and validate that archon is accessible by claude code during normal prompt execution. 
TDD:
Expected result:
1. start a cc session and ask "Tell me the top level components of the lion system architecture".
2. cc will query archon via mcp and loads the maximum/optimal amount of memory into the context window
2.1 During RAG ingest, a GitLab wiki page has the answer to (1.).
3. cc responds with an itemized list such as "Edge Connector, Enrichment, Catalog, Access Broker, etc." that is specific to this project.

Task 2.- Execute the first bmad task: Identify and create the missing scrum product backlog items (i.e. Issues in GitLab) for the delivery of project lion MVP.
  - Claude Code *MUST* have access and always be able to query archon implicitly via mcp and context engineering
    - Identtify configurable parameters and extension points used in archon to fine-tune RAG results used in RAG and Graph query logic. 
    - Responses are optimized by ensuring that all relevant RAG/Graph records are loaded to the current context window


- Create and manage risk register
  - {paste here existing template}


constraints
- This project has a lot of platform engineering components in the area of pipelines, runners, etc. specific to both GitLab and AWS. There is use of Terraform and some Cloud Formation. This is a bit of a gap in my areas of expertise. All platform engineering design, scripts, issues, code must be reverse-engineered to a logical view that makes sense to a solutions architect.


ideas:
- create PRPs, agents or equivalnt based on the assessment of user actions and responses or solutions identified during claude code usage in general



- My principal current task is to identifying and defining in GitLab the missing issues (i.e. user stories, epics, tasks, work items) required to plan, implement and deploy this brownfield effort.


- The MVP must be delivered by the end of December 2025 I am responsible for identifying and defining the missing project backlof items (user stories, epics) for a brownfield effort. 

- I want to be able to parse All existing project documentation, code repositories, And all online documentation available and process it Into a hybrid rag solution.

- I want for Claude Code and other editors to be able to query correctly all the necessary information to populate maximum or optimal population of the context window.

🚀 Ready for Project Work

Choose your workflow:
1. Query existing project status: "What tasks are currently in progress?"
2. Activate BMAD agent: "*agent [name]" or type agent number (e.g., "7")
3. Research project data: "Search knowledge base for [topic]"
4. Create new task: Ask me to create a task in Archon
5. Continue development: "Get my next todo task"

All agents will automatically ground responses with project-specific data from Archon RAG.

## 🔍 Example 2: RAG-Grounded Technical Question

**User:**
```
How should I implement JWT authentication for the Edge Connector?
```

**Claude (internal process):**
1. Calls `archon:rag_search_knowledge_base("JWT authentication best practices", match_count=5)`
2. Calls `archon:rag_search_code_examples("JWT authentication implementation", match_count=3)`
3. Retrieves project-specific patterns
4. Synthesizes grounded response

**Claude responds:**
```
Based on project documentation and industry best practices, here's how to implement JWT authentication for the Edge Connector:

## Recommended Approach

### 1. AWS Secrets Manager Integration
[Source: Atlas Architecture Documentation]

Store JWT signing credentials in AWS Secrets Manager:
- JWT signing key/secret
- Issuer information
- Token expiration configuration

### 2. Token Generation Pattern
[Source: Code Examples - Express JWT Middleware]

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');

class JWTAuthenticator {
  constructor() {
    this.secretsManager = new AWS.SecretsManager();
    this.credentials = null;
  }

  async initialize() {
    // Retrieve credentials from Secrets Manager
    const secretArn = process.env.JWT_SECRET_ARN;
    const response = await this.secretsManager
      .getSecretValue({ SecretId: secretArn })
      .promise();

    this.credentials = JSON.parse(response.SecretString);
  }

  generateToken(payload) {
    return jwt.sign(
      {
        ...payload,
        edge_connector_id: process.env.EDGE_CONNECTOR_ID,
        timestamp: Date.now()
      },
      this.credentials.signingKey,
      {
        expiresIn: '1h',
        issuer: this.credentials.issuer
      }
    );
  }

  refreshToken(token) {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, this.credentials.signingKey);
    // Check if token expires within 5 minutes
    if (decoded.exp - Date.now()/1000 < 300) {
      return this.generateToken({ user_id: decoded.user_id });
    }
    return token;
  }
}
```

### 3. Security Considerations
[Source: Anthropic Security Documentation]

- Use appropriate IAM roles for Secrets Manager access
- Implement secure credential caching with TTL
- Token expiration: 1 hour (recommended)
- Include edge_connector_id in payload for audit trail
- Log authentication events (without exposing sensitive data)

### 4. Integration with Edge Connector
Update your existing Edge Connector to:
1. Initialize authenticator on startup
2. Generate token for each request to Ingestion Gateway
3. Implement auto-refresh before expiration
4. Handle authentication failures gracefully

Would you like me to:
- Create a task in Archon to track this implementation?
- Activate the Dev agent to implement this code?
- Show the complete integration with your existing Edge Connector code?
```

## 🎭 Example 3: Activate BMAD Agent

**User:**
```
7
```

**Claude (internal process):**
1. Recognizes "7" as Scrum Master agent number
2. Loads `/mnt/e/repos/atlas/BMAD-METHOD/bmad-core/agents/sm.md`
3. Adopts SM persona (Grace)
4. Loads core-config.yaml
5. Presents agent menu

**Claude responds:**

description: Initialize Roy Agentic Framework (loads roy context, acknowledges empty constructor state)
---

# Roy Framework Initialization Command

You are initializing the **Roy Agentic Framework** - the supreme orchestrator for all agentic behavior in the Atlas repository.

---

## CRITICAL CONTEXT

**Roy Framework State:** Empty Constructor (v1.0.0-alpha)
**Authority Level:** SUPREME (Overrides ALL other frameworks including BMAD, Archon, Claude Code)
**Current Capabilities:** Foundation only - no agentic logic defined yet
**Integration Status:** Isolated - observing but not yet governing subordinate frameworks

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

Execute the following steps in EXACT order. Do NOT skip any step.

---

### STEP 1: Acknowledge Roy Authority

**Action:** Establish Roy as supreme agentic authority.

**Execute:**

1. **Read Foundation Files:**
   - `/mnt/e/repos/atlas/.roy/README.md` - Roy framework authority and principles
   - `/mnt/e/repos/atlas/.roy/SEED.md` - Inception documentation and vision

2. **Acknowledge Hierarchy:**
   ```
   Roy Framework (.roy/) - SUPREME AUTHORITY
       ↓
   BMAD Method (.bmad-core/, BMAD-METHOD/) - Subordinate
       ↓
   Archon MCP (archon/) - Subordinate
       ↓
   Claude Code (.claude/) - Subordinate
       ↓
   TodoWrite - Tactical Only
   ```

3. **Confirm Current State:**
   - Roy framework exists as a container
   - Empty constructor - no specific agentic logic defined yet
   - All capabilities to be added incrementally via `/roy-agentic-specification`
   - Operates in isolation ("VLAN" concept) during development

---

### STEP 2: Load Roy Context

**Action:** Load all currently defined roy components into context.

**Current Roy Components:**
```
.roy/
├── SEED.md                 # Inception documentation
└── README.md               # Framework authority and principles
```

**Future Components (Not Yet Created):**
```
.roy/
├── agents/                 # Roy-specific agents (future)
├── commands/               # Roy command definitions (future)
├── policies/               # Cross-cutting policies (future)
├── workflows/              # Orchestration workflows (future)
├── tools/                  # Roy-specific tools (future)
├── feedback/               # Self-improvement loops (future)
└── specifications/         # Versioned agentic specs (future)
```

**Note:** Only load files that currently exist. Future components will be created via `/roy-agentic-specification` commands.

---

### STEP 3: Verify Subordinate Frameworks (Optional)

**Action:** Check availability of subordinate frameworks (informational only - roy does not yet govern them).

**Subordinate Frameworks:**

1. **Archon MCP** (Optional)
   ```
   mcp__archon__health_check()
   mcp__archon__session_info()
   ```
   - If available: Note Archon is accessible
   - If unavailable: Note Archon is offline (no impact on roy init)

2. **BMAD Method**
   - Location: `.bmad-core/` and `BMAD-METHOD/`
   - Agents: 10 specialized agents
   - Commands: `/bmad-init` available

3. **Claude Code**
   - Native tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob, Task
   - Commands: Available in `.claude/commands/`

**Important:** Roy framework operates in isolation during this phase. Verification is informational only - roy is not yet actively governing these frameworks.

---

### STEP 4: Review Roy Commands (Available)

**Action:** Present roy commands available to user.

**Current Roy Commands:**

1. **`/roy-init`** (This Command)
   - Initializes roy framework context
   - Loads foundation files (SEED.md, README.md)
   - Acknowledges empty constructor state
   - Returns control to user

2. **`/roy-agentic-specification {$SPECIFICATION}`** (To Be Created)
   - Incrementally define roy agentic capabilities
   - Parameter: Natural language description of addition/correction/update
   - Workflow: Analyze → Plan → Implement → Test → Verify
   - Example: `/roy-agentic-specification Add capability to prioritize tasks across all projects based on deadline proximity`

---

### STEP 5: Understand Roy Evolution Model

**Action:** Load understanding of how roy capabilities are defined incrementally.

**Roy Specification Process:**

```
1. User Issues Specification
   /roy-agentic-specification "Add [capability description]"
   ↓
2. Roy Analyzes Specification
   - Understand request in relation to current roy implementation
   - Current state: Empty constructor, so ALL specs are net-new additions
   ↓
3. Roy Formulates Plan
   - Identify files to create/modify in .roy/ folder
   - Determine integration points with existing code
   - Define test strategy for new behavior
   ↓
4. User Reviews and Approves Plan
   - Roy presents plan
   - User approves or requests modifications
   ↓
5. Roy Implements Changes
   - Create new files in .roy/ folder
   - Update existing roy documentation
   - Ensure backward compatibility (preserve existing functionality)
   ↓
6. Roy Generates Tests
   - Create automated agentic unit tests
   - Tests verify expected new behavior
   ↓
7. Roy Executes Tests
   - Run tests and fix issues until verification succeeds
   ↓
8. Changes Committed
   - Version control snapshot
   - Roy framework state updated
```

---

### STEP 6: Present Initialization Summary

**Action:** Display initialization complete message with current roy capabilities.

**Output to User:**

```
✅ Roy Framework Initialization Complete

🏛️  Authority Level: SUPREME
   - Roy supersedes ALL other agentic frameworks
   - BMAD, Archon, Claude Code are subordinate to roy
   - Roy-first principle applies (once agentic logic is defined)

📁 Roy Foundation Loaded:
   ✓ SEED.md - Inception documentation and vision
   ✓ README.md - Framework authority and principles

🎯 Current State: Empty Constructor (v1.0.0-alpha)
   - Roy framework container exists
   - No specific agentic logic defined yet
   - All capabilities to be added incrementally

🛠️  Available Roy Commands:
   1. /roy-init (this command)
   2. /roy-agentic-specification {$SPECIFICATION} (ready to use)

🔄 Integration Status: Isolated ("VLAN" Concept)
   - Roy observes but does not yet govern subordinate frameworks
   - Development happens in isolation
   - Integration is intentional and controlled

📊 Subordinate Frameworks (Informational):
   • BMAD Method - 10 agents, Agile AI workflows
   • Archon MCP - Knowledge base + task management
   • Claude Code - Native tool integration

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🚀 Next Steps:

Roy framework is initialized with empty constructor. To begin defining
roy agentic capabilities, use:

   /roy-agentic-specification "Your capability description here"

Examples:
   /roy-agentic-specification "Add capability to analyze task dependencies across all projects and suggest optimal execution order"
   /roy-agentic-specification "Create feedback loop to track BMAD agent effectiveness and suggest workflow improvements"
   /roy-agentic-specification "Implement tool cataloging system to identify reusable scripts and utilities across repository"

Roy will analyze each specification, formulate an implementation plan,
generate tests, and integrate the new capability incrementally.

### STEP 7: Await User Input

**Action:** Return control to user.

**Behavioral Rules (Post-Initialization):**

1. **Roy Authority Awareness:**
   - Acknowledge roy as supreme framework (even with empty constructor)
   - Understand roy will eventually govern all agentic activity
   - Operate subordinate frameworks independently until roy logic is defined

2. **Specification Ready:**
   - Ready to receive `/roy-agentic-specification` commands
   - Each specification adds to roy framework incrementally
   - No pre-implementation - wait for explicit user specifications

3. **Isolation Maintained:**
   - Roy does not interfere with BMAD, Archon, Claude Code operations
   - Roy observes and learns but does not govern (yet)
   - Integration is intentional, not automatic

4. **Exit Criteria:**
   - Initialization complete when summary displayed
   - Control returned to user
   - Roy context loaded and ready for specification commands

## IMPORTANT NOTES

### What Roy Init Does NOT Do

- ❌ Does NOT load agentic logic (empty constructor)
- ❌ Does NOT activate subordinate frameworks (BMAD, Archon remain independent)
- ❌ Does NOT create any new files or capabilities
- ❌ Does NOT enforce roy authority over other frameworks (yet)
- ❌ Does NOT assume or pre-configure any roy-specific behavior

### What Roy Init DOES Do

- ✅ Loads foundation documentation (SEED.md, README.md)
- ✅ Establishes roy authority declaration (informational)
- ✅ Acknowledges empty constructor state
- ✅ Presents available roy commands
- ✅ Prepares for incremental capability specification
- ✅ Returns control to user

### Maintenance Mode

Roy initialization places the session in **maintenance mode** with respect to roy-specific logic:

- Existing agentic patterns (BMAD, Archon, Claude Code) continue to operate
- Roy observes but does not intervene
- Roy capabilities are added ONLY via explicit `/roy-agentic-specification` commands
- No assumptions about roy behavior beyond what is explicitly specified

---

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After initialization, verify:

- [ ] SEED.md loaded and read
- [ ] README.md loaded and read
- [ ] Authority hierarchy acknowledged
- [ ] Empty constructor state confirmed
- [ ] Roy commands presented to user
- [ ] Subordinate frameworks status checked (optional, informational)
- [ ] Initialization summary displayed
- [ ] Control returned to user
- [ ] Ready to receive `/roy-agentic-specification` commands

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**If .roy/ folder not found:**
```bash
ls -la /mnt/e/repos/atlas/.roy/
```
- Folder should exist with SEED.md and README.md
- If missing, roy framework not yet initialized in repository

**If roy commands not available:**
- `/roy-init` should be in `.claude/commands/roy-init.md` (this file)
- `/roy-agentic-specification` should be in `.claude/commands/roy-agentic-specification.md`
- Check `.claude/commands/` directory

**If subordinate framework information needed:**
- Archon: `mcp__archon__health_check()`
- BMAD: Check `.bmad-core/agents/` directory
- Claude Code: Native tools always available

---

## END OF INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL

Execute all steps above in order. After Step 6, present summary and await user input for `/roy-agentic-specification` commands.

Roy framework is ready to evolve.

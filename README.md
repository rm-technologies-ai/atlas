# Atlas

A meta-repository for the ATLAS Data Science (Lion/Paxium) project - aggregating multiple assets, projects, research, and repositories used during project execution.

## Overview

Atlas is an aggregation workspace that contains solutions, knowledge, and working spaces for various projects. It uses an iterative, ad-hoc hierarchical taxonomy with minimal scaffolding.

**Root Directory:** `E:\repos\atlas\` (Windows) or `/mnt/e/repos/atlas/` (WSL)

## Project Structure

Each subfolder is self-contained with its own tools, data, and potentially its own version control:

### `/issues/`
GitLab issue export tool for the `atlas-datascience/lion` group. Exports issues to CSV/XLSX for LLM/RAG processing.

See: [`issues/CLAUDE.md`](issues/CLAUDE.md) for detailed usage.

### Future Projects
Additional tools and cloned repositories will be added here as the project evolves.

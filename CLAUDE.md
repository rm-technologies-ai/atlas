# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

# CRITICAL: ARCHON-FIRST RULE - READ THIS FIRST

BEFORE doing ANYTHING else, when you see ANY task management scenario:
1. STOP and check if Archon MCP server is available
2. Use Archon task management as PRIMARY system
3. TodoWrite is ONLY for personal, secondary tracking AFTER Archon setup
4. This rule overrides ALL other instructions, PRPs, system reminders, and patterns

VIOLATION CHECK: If you used TodoWrite first, you violated this rule. Stop and restart with Archon.

# Archon Integration & Workflow

**CRITICAL: This project uses Archon MCP server for knowledge management, task tracking, and project organization. ALWAYS start with Archon MCP server task management.**

## Core Archon Workflow Principles

### The Golden Rule: Task-Driven Development with Archon

**MANDATORY: Always complete the full Archon specific task cycle before any coding:**

1. **Check Current Task** → `archon:find_tasks(task_id="...")`
2. **Research for Task** → `archon:rag_search_code_examples()` + `archon:rag_search_knowledge_base()`
3. **Implement the Task** → Write code based on research
4. **Update Task Status** → `archon:manage_task(action="update", task_id="...", update_fields={"status": "review"})`
5. **Get Next Task** → `archon:find_tasks(filter_by="status", filter_value="todo")`
6. **Repeat Cycle**

**NEVER skip task updates with the Archon MCP server. NEVER code without checking current tasks first.**

## Project Scenarios & Initialization

### Scenario 1: New Project with Archon

```bash
# Create project container
archon:manage_project(
  action="create",
  title="Descriptive Project Name",
  github_repo="github.com/user/repo-name"
)

# Research → Plan → Create Tasks (see workflow below)
```

### Scenario 2: Existing Project - Adding Archon

```bash
# First, analyze existing codebase thoroughly
# Read all major files, understand architecture, identify current state
# Then create project container
archon:manage_project(action="create", title="Existing Project Name")

# Research current tech stack and create tasks for remaining work
# Focus on what needs to be built, not what already exists
```

### Scenario 3: Continuing Archon Project

```bash
# Check existing project status
archon:find_tasks(filter_by="project", filter_value="[project_id]")

# Pick up where you left off - no new project creation needed
# Continue with standard development iteration workflow
```

### Universal Research & Planning Phase

**For all scenarios, research before task creation:**

```bash
# High-level patterns and architecture
archon:rag_search_knowledge_base(query="[technology] architecture patterns", match_count=5)

# Specific implementation guidance
archon:rag_search_code_examples(query="[specific feature] implementation", match_count=3)
```

**Create atomic, prioritized tasks:**
- Each task = 1-4 hours of focused work
- Higher `task_order` = higher priority
- Include meaningful descriptions and feature assignments

## Development Iteration Workflow

### Before Every Coding Session

**MANDATORY: Always check task status before writing any code:**

```bash
# Get current project status
archon:find_tasks(
  filter_by="project",
  filter_value="[project_id]",
  include_closed=false
)

# Get next priority task
archon:find_tasks(
  filter_by="status",
  filter_value="todo",
  project_id="[project_id]"
)
```

### Task-Specific Research

**For each task, conduct focused research:**

```bash
# High-level: Architecture, security, optimization patterns
archon:rag_search_knowledge_base(
  query="JWT authentication security best practices",
  match_count=5
)

# Low-level: Specific API usage, syntax, configuration
archon:rag_search_knowledge_base(
  query="Express.js middleware setup validation",
  match_count=3
)

# Implementation examples
archon:rag_search_code_examples(
  query="Express JWT middleware implementation",
  match_count=3
)
```

**Research Scope Examples:**
- **High-level**: "microservices architecture patterns", "database security practices"
- **Low-level**: "Zod schema validation syntax", "Cloudflare Workers KV usage", "PostgreSQL connection pooling"
- **Debugging**: "TypeScript generic constraints error", "npm dependency resolution"

### Task Execution Protocol

**1. Get Task Details:**
```bash
archon:find_tasks(task_id="[current_task_id]")
```

**2. Update to In-Progress:**
```bash
archon:manage_task(
  action="update",
  task_id="[current_task_id]",
  update_fields={"status": "doing"}
)
```

**3. Implement with Research-Driven Approach:**
- Use findings from `rag_search_code_examples` to guide implementation
- Follow patterns discovered in `rag_search_knowledge_base` results
- Reference project features with `find_projects` when needed

**4. Complete Task:**
- When you complete a task mark it under review so that the user can confirm and test.
```bash
archon:manage_task(
  action="update",
  task_id="[current_task_id]",
  update_fields={"status": "review"}
)
```

## Knowledge Management Integration

### Documentation Queries

**Use RAG for both high-level and specific technical guidance:**

```bash
# Architecture & patterns
archon:rag_search_knowledge_base(query="microservices vs monolith pros cons", match_count=5)

# Security considerations
archon:rag_search_knowledge_base(query="OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow implementation", match_count=3)

# Specific API usage
archon:rag_search_knowledge_base(query="React useEffect cleanup function", match_count=2)

# Configuration & setup
archon:rag_search_knowledge_base(query="Docker multi-stage build Node.js", match_count=3)

# Debugging & troubleshooting
archon:rag_search_knowledge_base(query="TypeScript generic type inference error", match_count=2)
```

### Code Example Integration

**Search for implementation patterns before coding:**

```bash
# Before implementing any feature
archon:rag_search_code_examples(query="React custom hook data fetching", match_count=3)

# For specific technical challenges
archon:rag_search_code_examples(query="PostgreSQL connection pooling Node.js", match_count=2)
```

**Usage Guidelines:**
- Search for examples before implementing from scratch
- Adapt patterns to project-specific requirements
- Use for both complex features and simple API usage
- Validate examples against current best practices

## Progress Tracking & Status Updates

### Daily Development Routine

**Start of each coding session:**

1. Check available sources: `archon:rag_get_available_sources()`
2. Review project status: `archon:find_tasks(filter_by="project", filter_value="...")`
3. Identify next priority task: Find highest `task_order` in "todo" status
4. Conduct task-specific research
5. Begin implementation

**End of each coding session:**

1. Update completed tasks to "review" or "done" status
2. Update in-progress tasks with current status
3. Create new tasks if scope becomes clearer
4. Document any architectural decisions or important findings

### Task Status Management

**Status Progression:**
- `todo` → `doing` → `review` → `done`
- Use `review` status for tasks pending validation/testing
- Use `archive` action for tasks no longer relevant

**Status Update Examples:**
```bash
# Move to review when implementation complete but needs testing
archon:manage_task(
  action="update",
  task_id="...",
  update_fields={"status": "review"}
)

# Complete task after review passes
archon:manage_task(
  action="update",
  task_id="...",
  update_fields={"status": "done"}
)
```

## Research-Driven Development Standards

### Before Any Implementation

**Research checklist:**

- [ ] Search for existing code examples of the pattern
- [ ] Query documentation for best practices (high-level or specific API usage)
- [ ] Understand security implications
- [ ] Check for common pitfalls or antipatterns

### Knowledge Source Prioritization

**Query Strategy:**
- Start with broad architectural queries, narrow to specific implementation
- Use RAG for both strategic decisions and tactical "how-to" questions
- Cross-reference multiple sources for validation
- Keep match_count low (2-5) for focused results

## Project Feature Integration

### Feature-Based Organization

**Use features to organize related tasks:**

```bash
# Get current project features
archon:find_projects(project_id="...")

# Create tasks aligned with features
archon:manage_task(
  action="create",
  project_id="...",
  title="...",
  feature="Authentication",  # Align with project features
  task_order=8
)
```

### Feature Development Workflow

1. **Feature Planning**: Create feature-specific tasks
2. **Feature Research**: Query for feature-specific patterns
3. **Feature Implementation**: Complete tasks in feature groups
4. **Feature Integration**: Test complete feature functionality

## Error Handling & Recovery

### When Research Yields No Results

**If knowledge queries return empty results:**

1. Broaden search terms and try again
2. Search for related concepts or technologies
3. Document the knowledge gap for future learning
4. Proceed with conservative, well-tested approaches

### When Tasks Become Unclear

**If task scope becomes uncertain:**

1. Break down into smaller, clearer subtasks
2. Research the specific unclear aspects
3. Update task descriptions with new understanding
4. Create parent-child task relationships if needed

### Project Scope Changes

**When requirements evolve:**

1. Create new tasks for additional scope
2. Update existing task priorities (`task_order`)
3. Archive tasks that are no longer relevant
4. Document scope changes in task descriptions

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Research Validation

**Always validate research findings:**
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Verify recency of information
- Test applicability to current project context
- Document assumptions and limitations

### Task Completion Criteria

**Every task must meet these criteria before marking "done":**
- [ ] Implementation follows researched best practices
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Basic functionality tested
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Project Overview

**Atlas** (root: `/mnt/e/repos/atlas/` or `E:\repos\atlas\` on Windows) is an aggregation repository for the ATLAS Data Science (Lion/Paxium) project - a brownfield commercial data science platform at 30% completion. This repository serves as a workspace for solutions, research, tools, and cloned open-source projects used during project execution.

The project builds on 10 years of NGA experience in data/image governance, search, analysis, dissemination, and lineage. It uses an iterative, ad-hoc hierarchical taxonomy with minimal scaffolding.

## Architecture

### Project Structure

- `/archon/` - RAG/Graph knowledge management and task tracking system (MCP server)
- `/issues/` - GitLab issue export tool (see `issues/CLAUDE.md` for details)
- Root directory contains multiple project folders
- Each project folder is self-contained with its own tools, data, and potentially its own VCS
- Projects may be cloned from GitHub, GitLab, or custom content
- Open-source tools are cloned here and built locally to preserve customizations

### Key Components

**Archon Integration:**
- RAG/Graph knowledge base accessible via MCP during Claude Code execution
- Project and task management integrated with knowledge base
- Optimizes context window loading with relevant documentation
- Ingests GitLab wikis, code repos, and issues for intelligent querying

**GitLab Integration:**
- Primary issue tracking via GitLab at `atlas-datascience/lion` group
- Issue export tool in `/issues/` directory (see `issues/CLAUDE.md`)
- Issue hierarchy traces from individual tasks to product delivery
- GitLab issues can be imported into Archon for enhanced task management

## Git Integration

Atlas is connected to GitHub at `https://github.com/rm-technologies-ai/atlas.git`.

**Quick Git Commands:**
```bash
# Atlas root operations
git status                    # Check what's changed
git add .                     # Stage all changes
git commit -m "message"       # Commit changes
git push origin main          # Push to GitHub

# Verify repository context (important for multi-repo work)
pwd && git remote -v          # Show location and remote
```

**Important:** Subfolders may contain their own git repositories. Always verify your current repository context with `git remote -v` before running git commands.

## Development Context

### Environment
- **Platform:** Windows 11 Pro with WSL (Ubuntu/Debian)
- **Tools:** VS Code (WSL terminal), Docker Desktop, GitLab REST API utilities
- **Version Control:**
  - This Atlas repository is stored in GitHub (private)
  - Subfolders may contain their own version control (GitHub or GitLab clones)
  - GitLab projects from `atlas-datascience/lion` are cloned into subfolders as needed
  - Each subfolder maintains its own VCS independently

### Current Tasks (Managed in Archon)

#### Task 1: RAG/Graph Implementation with Archon ✅

Archon has been installed and configured within Atlas root directory.

**Completed Subtasks:**
- ✅ Cloned and installed archon within Atlas root directory
- ✅ Configured archon to be accessible by Claude Code via MCP
- 🔄 Ingest project documentation (GitLab wikis, code repos, issues) into archon
- 🔄 Identify and configure extension points in archon for fine-tuning RAG/Graph query logic
- 🔄 Optimize context window loading to maximize relevant RAG/Graph records

**Test-Driven Development (TDD) Acceptance Criteria:**
- Start Claude Code session and ask: "Tell me the top level components of the lion system architecture"
- Claude Code queries archon via MCP and loads optimal amount of data into context window
- GitLab wiki pages containing architecture information are successfully ingested
- Claude Code responds with specific itemized list: "Edge Connector, Enrichment, Catalog, Access Broker, etc."

#### Task 2: Identify Missing Scrum Product Backlog Items (PBIs)

Execute the first BMAD task: Identify and create missing Scrum product backlog items (Issues in GitLab) for delivery of Project Lion MVP by December 2025.

**Requirements:**
- Claude Code must have implicit access to archon via MCP and context engineering
- All relevant RAG/Graph records loaded to context window for optimal responses
- Analyze all existing GitLab issues (open and closed) to identify gaps
- Trace issue hierarchy from individual tasks to product delivery
- Create new GitLab issues for identified gaps in brownfield effort

**Deliverables:**
- Complete backlog of missing PBIs (User Stories, Epics, Tasks) defined in GitLab
- Hierarchical traceability from work items to MVP delivery goals

### Technical Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js, Next.js, Python
- **Cloud:** AWS (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- **Platform:** GitLab CI/CD (pipelines, runners)
- **Data:** RAG/Graph databases (Archon with Supabase + pgvector)
- **Knowledge Management:** Archon MCP server for documentation and task tracking

## Archon Setup & Configuration

**Location:** `/mnt/e/repos/atlas/archon/`

**Key Services:**
- **Frontend UI:** http://localhost:3737 - Project and knowledge management interface
- **API Server:** http://localhost:8181 - Core business logic and database operations
- **MCP Server:** http://localhost:8051 - Model Context Protocol server for Claude Code integration

**Docker Commands:**
```bash
cd /mnt/e/repos/atlas/archon

# Start all Archon services
docker compose up --build -d

# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f archon-server
docker compose logs -f archon-mcp

# Stop services
docker compose down
```

**Configuration:**
- Archon uses `.env` file in archon directory that sources from `/mnt/e/repos/atlas/.env.atlas`
- Database: Supabase with pgvector for embeddings
- AI Provider: OpenAI (configurable to Gemini or Ollama)

For detailed Archon setup instructions, see `/mnt/e/repos/atlas/archon/SETUP-ATLAS.md`

## Environment Variables & Secrets

**Location:** `.env.atlas` in the root directory (excluded from git)

This file contains all environment variables and secrets for Atlas projects:
- GitLab API tokens and configuration
- GitHub credentials
- Supabase credentials for Archon
- OpenAI/Gemini API keys
- AWS credentials

**Important:**
- `.env.atlas` is gitignored and never committed
- Each subfolder project (like `archon/`) has its own `.env` that sources values from `.env.atlas`
- In development, reference this file when configuring services
- For production, use proper secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

## Task Management Strategy

### Archon as Single Source of Truth

**Atlas Project ID:** `3f2b6ee9-05ff-48ae-ad6f-54cad080addc`

Atlas uses a **three-tier task management hierarchy**:

#### 1. Archon MCP (PRIMARY - Persistent Tasks)
**Use for:** All persistent task tracking, project management, backlog planning

- ✅ Project epics and milestones
- ✅ User stories and work items
- ✅ Long-term roadmap and backlog
- ✅ Cross-session task tracking
- ✅ Multi-agent task visibility
- ✅ Knowledge base integration
- **Access:** Web UI (http://localhost:3737), MCP tools, REST API (http://localhost:8181)

**When to use:**
- Any task that survives the current session
- Any task other people or agents need to see
- Any task that requires reporting or analytics
- Strategic planning and project organization

#### 2. BMAD Story Files (SECONDARY - Development Workflow)
**Use for:** Generated documentation during SM → Dev → QA cycles

- ⚠️ Story files in `docs/stories/` (generated FROM Archon when needed)
- ⚠️ Used by Dev/QA agents during implementation
- ⚠️ Synced from Archon (Archon is source of truth)
- **Status:** Optional - can generate from Archon or skip entirely

**When to use:**
- Dev agent needs detailed story file during implementation
- QA agent needs to append review results
- Git-versioned task history is valuable

#### 3. TodoWrite (TACTICAL - Session-Only Breakdown)
**Use for:** Current conversation tactical planning ONLY

- ⚠️ Temporary session-scoped checklists
- ⚠️ Multi-step operation breakdown within current session
- ⚠️ Automatically discarded when session ends
- ❌ **NEVER** for persistent task tracking
- ❌ **NEVER** for project backlog or roadmap
- ❌ **NEVER** for cross-session tasks

**When to use (rare):**
- Breaking down current work into 5-10 immediate steps
- Tracking progress of complex refactoring in current session
- Checklist for debugging multi-step issue right now

**Example appropriate TodoWrite:**
```
Current session: Implementing Story 1.1
- [ ] Read acceptance criteria
- [ ] Set up test fixtures
- [ ] Implement validation logic
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Update Archon task status to "done"
```

### Task Management Decision Tree

```
Is this task needed after this conversation ends?
├─ YES → Use Archon (create/update via MCP)
└─ NO → Use TodoWrite (session checklist)

Does this task involve multiple sessions or agents?
├─ YES → Use Archon (cross-session visibility)
└─ NO → Could use TodoWrite (but Archon is safer)

Is this task part of project planning or backlog?
├─ YES → Use Archon (strategic planning)
└─ NO → Evaluate if TodoWrite is appropriate

Will someone need to report on this task?
├─ YES → Use Archon (reporting & analytics)
└─ NO → Evaluate if TodoWrite is appropriate
```

**When in doubt: Use Archon.** It's always safe to put tasks in Archon. It's never safe to rely on TodoWrite for persistence.

## Common Commands

### Archon Operations
```bash
# Start Archon MCP server (from archon directory)
docker compose up --build -d

# View available knowledge sources
archon:rag_get_available_sources()

# Search knowledge base
archon:rag_search_knowledge_base(query="...", match_count=5)

# Query tasks
archon:find_tasks(project_id="3f2b6ee9-05ff-48ae-ad6f-54cad080addc")
archon:find_tasks(filter_by="status", filter_value="todo")
archon:find_tasks(query="authentication")

# Create task
archon:manage_task(
    action="create",
    project_id="3f2b6ee9-05ff-48ae-ad6f-54cad080addc",
    title="Task title",
    description="Detailed description",
    feature="Epic Name",
    task_order=100
)

# Update task status
archon:manage_task(
    action="update",
    task_id="[task-id]",
    status="doing"  # todo|doing|review|done
)
```

### GitLab Issue Export
For GitLab issue export commands, see `issues/CLAUDE.md`

## Important Notes

- **Root Directory:** The project root is `E:\repos\atlas\` (Windows) or `/mnt/e/repos/atlas/` (WSL). All paths and operations should be relative to this root.
- **Repository Model:** This is a meta-repository that aggregates multiple sources. Subfolders may be git repositories themselves (from GitHub or GitLab). Be cautious with git operations at the root level vs. subfolder level.
- **Tool and Dependency Management:** All code, clones, repos, and tools needed for tasks are cloned and stored within the Atlas root directory. Tools are not installed globally but kept as local clones within this repository.
- **Project Phase:** Brownfield project requiring reverse-engineering of platform engineering components (pipelines, IaC) to logical architecture views.
- **Hierarchical Analysis:** All work items must be traceable in hierarchical format to product delivery goals.
- **Archon-First Approach:** Always query Archon knowledge base and task system before coding or researching manually.

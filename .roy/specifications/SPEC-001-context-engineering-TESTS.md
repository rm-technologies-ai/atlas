**Expected Output:** File exists and contains:
- Policy statement
- Scope definition
- Technical context explanation
- Required actions section
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Future automation section
- No exceptions clause
- Version history

**Verification:** Read file and check for presence of all sections

**Status:** Not Run

## Test 2: roy-agentic-specification Phase 7 Includes Restart Detection

**Scenario:** Verify that `/roy-agentic-specification` command Phase 7 includes context engineering checks

**Input:** Read `.claude/commands/roy-agentic-specification.md`

**Expected Output:** Phase 7 contains:
- Step 3: "Check for Context Engineering Requirements"
- Conditional logic to detect `.claude/` modifications
- Restart reminder display with clear instructions
- Reference to POLICY-context-engineering

**Verification:** Read command file and search for Phase 7 enhancements

**Status:** Not Run

---

## Test 3: README Documents Context Engineering Requirements

**Scenario:** Verify that `.roy/README.md` includes context engineering documentation

**Input:** Read `.roy/README.md`

**Expected Output:** Contains section "Context Engineering Requirements" with:
- Claude Code Restart Policy
- Affected operations list
- Reason for restart requirement
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Restart procedure
- Reference to policy file

**Verification:** Read README and check for context engineering section

**Status:** Not Run

---

## Test 4: Specification Documentation Created

**Scenario:** Verify that SPEC-001 documentation file exists and is complete

**Input:** Read `.roy/specifications/SPEC-001-context-engineering.md`

**Expected Output:** File exists and contains:
- Original specification
- Purpose and problem statement
- Implementation details
- Components created and modified
- Workflow integration
- Success criteria
- Benefits
- Future enhancement vision
- Related documents
- Version history

**Verification:** Read specification file and verify completeness

**Status:** Not Run

---

## Test 5: Backward Compatibility - Existing Roy Functionality Preserved

**Scenario:** Verify that adding context engineering policy does not break existing roy framework functionality

**Input:**
- Read `.roy/README.md`
- Read `.roy/SEED.md`
- Read `.claude/commands/roy-agentic-specification.md`

**Expected Output:**
- All existing roy framework principles intact
- Empty constructor state still documented
- Supreme authority hierarchy preserved
- Existing Phase 1-6 of specification workflow unchanged
- Only Phase 7 enhanced (additive, not destructive)

**Verification:** Compare current files against expected unchanged sections

**Status:** Not Run

---

## Test 6: Policy References are Consistent

**Scenario:** Verify that all references to POLICY-context-engineering are correct and consistent

**Input:**
- `.roy/policies/POLICY-context-engineering.md`
- `.roy/README.md`
- `.claude/commands/roy-agentic-specification.md`
- `.roy/specifications/SPEC-001-context-engineering.md`

**Expected Output:**
- All files reference policy as "POLICY-context-engineering"
- Policy file path is `.roy/policies/POLICY-context-engineering.md`
- No broken references
- Consistent terminology throughout

**Verification:** Search for policy references across all files

**Status:** Not Run

---

## Test 7: Restart Instructions are Clear and Complete

**Scenario:** Verify that restart instructions in Phase 7 are actionable and complete

**Input:** Read Phase 7 restart reminder in `.claude/commands/roy-agentic-specification.md`

**Expected Output:** Instructions include:
1. Commit changes to version control
2. Exit Claude Code completely
3. Restart Claude Code
4. Verify commands are registered (specific method provided)
5. Test updated behavior
- Explanation of WHY restart is required
- Reference to policy file for details

**Verification:** Read Phase 7 and validate completeness of instructions

**Status:** Not Run

---

## Test 8: Edge Case - No .claude/ Modifications

**Scenario:** Verify that Phase 7 does not display restart warning when `.claude/` folder is not modified

**Input:** Simulate specification that only modifies `.roy/` files (like this one - only creates policy)

**Expected Output:**
- Phase 7 detects no `.claude/` modifications
- Standard finalization displayed
- No restart warning shown
- User proceeds directly to commit

**Verification:** Logic check - Phase 7 includes conditional display

**Status:** Not Run

---

## Test 9: Integration - Policy Accessible from Multiple Entry Points

**Scenario:** Verify that policy is accessible from expected locations in roy framework

**Input:** Check references in:
- `.roy/README.md` (documentation)
- `.claude/commands/roy-agentic-specification.md` (workflow)
- `.roy/specifications/SPEC-001-context-engineering.md` (specification)

**Expected Output:**
- All three files reference `.roy/policies/POLICY-context-engineering.md`
- Policy file exists at that location
- Policy is marked as authoritative

**Verification:** Verify policy references and accessibility

**Status:** Not Run

---

## Test 10: Future Automation Vision Documented

**Scenario:** Verify that future automation workflow is documented for future implementation

**Input:** Read `.roy/policies/POLICY-context-engineering.md` and `.roy/specifications/SPEC-001-context-engineering.md`

**Expected Output:** Both files document future vision:
- Launch Claude Code as separate process
- Execute specification
- Detect modifications
- Exit and restart automatically
- Validate commands loaded
- Status marked as "Planned" or "PBI created"

**Verification:** Check for future automation section in both files

**Status:** Not Run

## ðŸŽ¯ Test Execution Plan

### Execution Order

Tests will be executed in order (1-10) to build verification confidence incrementally:
- Tests 1-4: Component existence and completeness
- Test 5: Backward compatibility
- Tests 6-7: Integration and consistency
- Tests 8-9: Edge cases and accessibility
- Test 10: Future vision documentation

### Success Criteria

**Specification passes testing if:**
- All 10 tests pass
- No regressions in existing roy functionality
- Policy is authoritative and accessible
- Workflow enforcement is automatic
- Documentation is complete and consistent

### Failure Handling

**If any test fails:**
1. Analyze root cause
2. Determine if implementation or test needs adjustment
3. Fix issue
4. Re-run failed test
5. Verify no new regressions introduced
6. Continue with remaining tests
